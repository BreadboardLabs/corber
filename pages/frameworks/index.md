corber currently supports:

- [Ember](/pages/frameworks/ember)
- [Vue](/pages/frameworks/vue) (for users of vue-cli/Webpack)
- [React](/pages/frameworks/react)
- [Glimmer](/pages/frameworks/glimmer)

Custom Frameworks can be integrated but are not well-documented. See [Frameworks/Extending](/pages/frameworks/extending).

In general, the experience for each framework is hands off. corber will
walk you through any necessary changes and warn you about problematic
framework configuration, such as base urls with a leading slash.
