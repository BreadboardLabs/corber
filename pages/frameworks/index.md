title:  "Frameworks"

corber currently supports:

- [Ember](/pages/frameworks/ember);
- [Glimmer](/pages/frameworks/glimmer);
- [Vue](/pages/frameworks/vue) (for users of vue-cli/Webpack);
- Custom Frameworks can be integrated, but are not well documented. See
  [configuration / extending](/pages/frameworks/extending);

In general the experience for each framework is hands off. corber will
walk you through any necessary changes and warn you about problematic
framework configuration, such as base urls with a leading slash.
