#### Adding Platfroms

After install, you will typically want to add a platform. corber comes with no platforms by default.

```cli
ec platform add ios
ec add android
```

Available platforms are:
- ios
- android
- blackberry
- windows

Browser as a platform will be respected, but does not imply 'webbrowser'.
