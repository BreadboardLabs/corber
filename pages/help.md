corber is still under active development, and we encourage you
reaching out with bugs and confusing points. There are two main support
avenues:

#### Github Issues ([link](https://github.com/isleofcode/corber/issues))

Please use issues to report bugs, edge cases and faulty implementations
/ documentation.

#### Slack

There is an #e-cordova channel on the [ember-slack](https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com), which is more geared towards how-to & implementation questions.
