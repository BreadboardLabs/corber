ember-cordova provides a pipeline & tooling for extending Ember.js & standalone Glimmer applications with Cordova.

Once [installed](pages/installation), building is as simple as:

```
ember cdv:build --platform=ios
ember cdv:build --platform=android
```

The project includes [on-device livereload](pages/workflow/livereload), a [CLI](pages/cli) for building & deploying to devices, automated [icon/splash generation](pages/workflow/icon_splash_management), a [device info service](pages/service_platform) and a growing ecosystem of plugins.

ember-cordova maintained by [Isle of Code](https://isleofcode.com) in Toronto, with a community of contributors.

See the [Installation](pages/installation) guides to get started, or watch [Hybrid/Ember best practices from EmberConf 2016](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ry639hvWKbM).
